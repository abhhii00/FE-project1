everything in this project went very well and in an oragnised way done and dusted but there is a problem i am facing is, that at the bottom of the code there is a div called "bottom" and until i make that div's position absolute its not displaying in background color or else i have to give the height in vh its not taking the value in percetage as much i tried. the problem is not that its not working or however i made it work, the problem is from whom i am learing this clone, that code is working just fine in their machine without any sweat. its taking height in percentage and without position property.
now i understand why i was getting that problem, becauase i had not given the measuremnts to the #main div, as it contains all the code that will be displayed on the website.
